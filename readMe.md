now i do understand the errors in this code, it isn't finished yet and will be finished when i come round to it.
Thats why as i'm writing this it is private but hey if i make it public i guess you get reasoning

addresses.json doesn't **work** right now because it's whole purpose is to stop brute forcing and i'm completely
ruining that whole purpose with the fact im checking when they log in, this is vulnerable because they will have
the password when they login but not be able to use the account on that ipaddr, this can be avoided with a proxy.
i might fix this.
